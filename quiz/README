# Part 1

- [*] Read in a quiz provided via a CSV file 
- [*] Keep track of how many questions answered correctly
- [*] The CSV file should default to problems.csv
- [*] Specify CSV file with a flag
- [*] Output the total number of questions correct and how many questions there were in total

## Problem Format

The first column is a question and the second column in the same row is the answer to that question. Quizzes will be relatively short (< 100 questions) and will have single word/number answers.

eg.

```csv
5+5,10
7+3,10
1+1,2
8+3,11
1+2,3
8+6,14
3+1,4
1+4,5
5+1,6
2+3,5
3+3,6
2+4,6
5+2,7
```

- [*] Prompt user to press enter before the timer starts
